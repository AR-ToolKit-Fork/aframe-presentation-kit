## Installation

1. [Download the repository (.ZIP)](https://github.com/ngokevin/aframe-presentation-kit/archive/master.zip)
2. Start the local server (`npm run start`)
3. Open `http://localhost:5000` in your browser

## Development

The kit uses [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/), an HTML
presentation framework. Read their documentation to see how to style and
present content the way you wish.

Modify the **CONTENT.md** file to edit content. Slides are written in Markdown
and separated by three hyphens `---`.  The first place to start would be to
update the author, date, and location in the title slide.

We suggest tailoring the content to your audience. You may want to filter out
slides depending on the answers to these questions (as well as the allotted
length of your talk):

- Is your audience familiar with virtual reality?
- Is your audience familiar with WebVR?
- Is your audience interested in underlying code (i.e., JavaScript, A-Frame components, three.js)?

## Deployment

In your GitHub repository settings page under **GitHub Pages** and *Source*,
select `master branch`. Then simply push to GitHub and your slides will be live
at `https://yourusername.github.io/aframe-presentation-kit` or whatever you
named the repository. [Read
